# Debian Docker Vagrant

All the necessary ingredients to build a Docker image for use with
Vagrant.

The main aim here is to make something that will work with Vagrant with
Docker as a drop-in replacement for VirtualBox/vagrant-lxc.

## Requirements

* vagrant >= 1.6.3
* docker (on Debian docker.io)
